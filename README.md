### System Requirements
* Linux
* MATLAB
 
### Install instructions

1. Download and install R-CNN code (https://github.com/rbgirshick/rcnn)
2. Following the instructions in R-CNN code, precompute fc7 features on the dataset (i.e. PASCAL VOC 2007)
3. Unpack this code.
4. Start Matlab
5. Mex compile the simplex projection cc code.

### Train & Test work flow

Extract (not finetuned) and save fc7 features on all Selective Search windows on your dataset (i.e. PASCAL VOC2007) -> Cluster features -> Initial detector training via coverage maximization -> Refine via Smooth Latent SVM -> Test the detectors.

### Usage

[A. Feature extraction on SS windows]
  1. Following the instructions in R-CNN code, precompute fc7 features.
  2. Save features under feat_cache/voc_2007_flip_0_layer_fc7_finetuned_0/

[B. Clustering] This is the slowest and the most computationally expensive step.
  1. On cluster, launch `cluster_patches_parallel_single_nogt_20x1.m` in parallel with inputs (positive image id, classid). The first argument goes from 1 ~ #positive image per class. The second argument goes from 1 ~ 20.
  2. This will save about 70GB of clustering results for PASCAL VOC2007 under directory `paris_results_nogt_20x1/%s_%d.mat` where the first string is for the image id and the second integer if for class id (1~20).

[C. Initial detector training via coverage maximization]
  1. Start matlab.
  2. Launch `train_classes_20x1_smooth_greedycover.m` with input (classid)

[D. Refine via Smooth Latent SVM]
  1. Start matlab
  2. Launch `train_classes_20x1_smooth_lsvm_topK_bagmine_greedycover.m` with input (classid)

[E. Test the detectors]
  1. Start matlab
  2. Launch `eval_classes_20x1_smooth_lsvm_topK_bagmine_greedycover.m` with input (classid)
  3. (optional) to save a nicely parsed table of AP numbers for each class, launch 
`parse_smooth_lsvm_topK_bagmine_greedycover_maxiter_june17.m`.
